/// Wraps child views onto multiple rows when they don't fit the available
/// width — needed so karaoke lines wrap naturally at the screen edge like
/// real running text, rather than being clipped or forced onto one line —
/// and positions each wrapped row per `alignment` (centered by default,
/// matching Spotify's own lyrics view and Spicetify's, rather than ragged
/// left-aligned text; configurable via the left/center/right setting).
///
/// SwiftUI's Layout protocol (the clean way to do this) is iOS 16+. This
/// project's only existing @available check gates at iOS 15, so on iOS 15
/// devices we fall back to a simple non-wrapping, centered HStack instead
/// of crashing — lines will run off-screen on iOS 15 rather than wrapping,
/// which is a known limitation rather than a silent bug, until/unless iOS
/// 15 support for this specific view is worth a more involved
/// manual-wrapping fallback.
