import SwiftUI

/// Karaoke lyrics view. Uses a SwiftUI TimelineView (the supported,
/// declarative equivalent of a manual CADisplayLink/Timer loop inside
/// SwiftUI) to re-evaluate playback position ~30 times per second,
/// determines which line is "active" right now, and renders all lines
/// with KaraokeLineView — auto-scrolling so the active line stays
/// vertically centered, matching Spicetify's lyrics panel behavior.
///
/// Lyrics text alignment (left/center/right, UserDefaults.karaokeOptions.
/// textAlignment) drives both the VStack's own alignment below and the
/// matching per-row alignment inside KaraokeFlowLayout — centered by
/// default, matching Spotify's own lyrics view and Spicetify's, rather
/// than ragged left-aligned text, but configurable via Settings. The
/// screen width is read explicitly via GeometryReader and threaded all
/// the way down to KaraokeLineView as a concrete `availableWidth`, rather
/// than relying on `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` to implicitly pass a
/// usable width to the custom Layout-conforming KaraokeFlowLayoutImpl.
/// That implicit approach is what an earlier version of this file used,
/// and it doesn't actually work for a custom Layout: `.frame(maxWidth:
/// .infinity)` expands the *outer* container to fill available space, but
/// during the sizing query it can still propose a nil/unspecified width
/// to the *child* — and KaraokeFlowLayoutImpl's sizeThatFits falls back
/// to `proposal.width ?? .infinity` when that happens, meaning no
/// wrapping decision gets made at all: the whole line renders as one long
/// unwrapped row at its natural width, which then gets positioned (not
/// centered the way a plain Text would be) within the expanded frame —
/// reading as left-aligned/overflowing rather than centered. Giving
/// KaraokeLineView a concrete, non-nil width to apply via `.frame(width:)`
/// (a fixed constraint, not a flexible one) removes that ambiguity
/// entirely.
