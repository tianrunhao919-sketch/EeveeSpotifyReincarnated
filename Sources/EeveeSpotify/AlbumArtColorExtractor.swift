/// every pixel of a full-resolution image), bucket pixels into a coarse
/// color-space grid (quantization), find the most populous buckets, and
/// return their average colors — a simplified median-cut/k-means-ish
/// technique. Not as visually refined as Android's Palette API (which
/// also classifies vibrant/muted/dark/light swatches), but sufficient for
