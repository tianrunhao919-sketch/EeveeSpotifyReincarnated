/// A single syllable/word-chunk with its own timing, used to drive
/// karaoke-style progressive highlight animation. Mirrors the real
/// SpicyLyrics extension's per-syllable model (Syllable.ts):
/// each syllable knows its own start/end time and whether the word
/// continues into the *next* syllable. IsPartOfWord is a forward-looking
/// flag — confirmed against the real client's Syllable.ts word-grouping
/// loop, which gates the current syllable's own group-continuation on
/// the *previous* syllable's flag (`lead.IsPartOfWord || (prev?.IsPartOfWord
/// && currentWordGroup)`), and against tools.ts's convertSyllableToStatic,
/// which appends a space *after* a syllable only `if (!syllable.IsPartOfWord)`.
/// Both treat the flag as "no gap follows this syllable" — i.e. it glues
/// onto what comes after it, not what came before. An earlier version of
/// this port read the flag backwards (as "glues onto the previous
/// syllable"), which produced exactly the broken spacing seen in some
/// songs — e.g. "Lo"+"la" (IsPartOfWord true on "Lo") rendering as
/// "Lo la" instead of "Lola", and "was"+"Lo" rendering as "wasLo" instead
/// of "was Lo" — since the old logic checked each syllable's own flag
/// instead of the one before it.
